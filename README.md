## Using:
**Combine Framework and SwiftUI**: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine

## Introduction:
> The Combine framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values of many kinds of asynchronous events (network request, user input, data updates).
> By creating a single processing chain (pipeline), each part performs actions on values received from upstream publishers and republish them.
